3. Procedure

3.1. Discovery and Initial Triage (L1 Support)

Confirm Criticality: The discoverer confirms the issue is a Severity 1 Critical Bug (System Down/Security Breach).

Immediate Notification: The discoverer notifies the Triage Team Lead (via Slack #critical-alerts) and the relevant Product Manager within 5 minutes of confirmation.

Jira Ticket Creation: The discoverer creates a new Jira ticket with the following mandatory fields:

Project: [PROD_ISSUE]

Issue Type: Bug

Priority: Highest

Summary: [CRITICAL] System X - Brief description of failure.

Description: Include Steps to Reproduce (STR), Expected Result, and Actual Result.

3.2. Investigation and Assignment (Triage Team)

SME Identification: The Triage Team Lead reviews the ticket and identifies the core component owner (SME).

Assignment: The ticket is assigned to the component SME within 15 minutes of creation.

Impact Analysis: The SME updates the Jira ticket with an assessment of system impact and potential remediation paths.

3.3. Resolution and Documentation

Code Fix & QA: The SME commits the fix to the emergency branch and works with QA to confirm the fix addresses the issue without new regressions.

Release Notes Draft: The Technical Writer (using Confluence) drafts a high-level, post-mortem summary and an updated release note describing the fix, which is linked directly to the closed Jira ticket.

Closure: Once deployed and verified in production, the Triage Team Lead closes the ticket and notifies all stakeholders.
