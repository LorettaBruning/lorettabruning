Instructions

The current life 
The current life cycle for a Jira story follows a pattern found in Exhibit 5-1. A story is created in Jira. The user marks the story for elaboration, moves the story to “ready for review,” then to “AC ready for approval,” then to “sizing,” and finally “to “DEV” for development. At any point, the story can be moved to “in progress, “blocked,” and marked as “invalid” or “duplicate.” Only after “ready for DEV” can the story progress to “done.”
