<para><title>GENERAL SAFETY NOTICES</title></para>
<para>The following general safety notices supplement the specific warnings and cautions appearing elsewhere in this manual.  They are recommended precautions that must be understood and applied during operation and maintenance of the equipment covered herein. Should situations arise that are not covered in the general or specific safety precautions, the (name of authority) will issue orders as deemed necessary to cover the situation.  No work shall be undertaken on energized equipment or circuits until approval of the authority is obtained, and then only in accordance with (reference document).</para>
<para><title>DO NOT REPAIR OR ADJUST ALONE</title></para>
<para>Under no circumstances shall repair or adjustment of energized equipment be attempted alone.  The immediate presence of someone capable of rendering first aid is required.  Before making adjustments, be sure to protect against grounding.  If possible, adjustments should be made with one hand, with the other hand free and clear of equipment.  Even when power has been removed from equipment circuits, dangerous potentials may still exist due to retention of charges by capacitors.  Circuits must be grounded and all capacitors discharged prior to attempting repairs.</para>
<para><title>TEST EQUIPMENT</title></para>
<para>Make certain test equipment is in good condition.  If a metal-cased test meter must be held, ground the case of the meter before starting measurement. Do not touch live equipment or personnel working on live equipment while holding a test meter.  Some types of measuring devices should not be grounded; these devices should not be held when taking measurements.</para>
<para><title>INTERLOCKS-SAFETY DEVICES</title></para>
<para>Interlocks are provided for safety of personnel and equipment and should be used only for the purpose intended.  Never tamper with or render ineffective any safety device, interlock, ground strap or similar device intended to protect operators or the equipment without specific approval of the authority. Do not depend solely upon interlocks for protection. Whenever possible, disconnect power at the distribution source.</para>
<para><title>MOVING EQUIPMENT</title></para>
<para>Personnel shall remain clear of moving equipment.  If equipment requires adjustment while in motion, a safety watch shall be posted. The safety watch shall have a full view of the operations being performed, and immediate access to controls capable of stopping equipment motion.</para>
<para><title>FIRST AID</title></para>
<para>An injury, no matter how slight, shall never go unattended. Always obtain first aid or medical attention immediately, and file an injury report in accordance with (regulation). </para>
<databrk>
<para><title>RESUSCITATION</title></para>
<para>Personnel working with or near high voltage shall be familiar with approved methods of resuscitation. Should someone be injured and stop breathing, begin resuscitation immediately.  A delay could cost the victim's life.  Resuscitation procedures shall be posted in all electrically hazardous areas.</para>
<para><title>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</title></para>
<para>The following general precautions are to be observed at all times.<seqlist>

<item id="c00fs001l009" label="9.">Consider all circuits not known to be "dead," "live" and dangerous at all times.</item>
<item id="c00fs001l010" label="10.">When working near electricity, do not use metal rules, flashlights, metallic pencils, or any other objects having exposed conducting material.</item>
<item id="c00fs001l019" label="11.">De-energize all equipment before connecting or disconnecting meters or test leads.</item>
<item id="c00fs001l012" label="12.">When connecting a meter to terminals for measurement, use range higher than expected voltage.</item> 
<item id="c00fs001l013" label="13.">Before operating equipment or performing any tests or measurements, ensure that frames of all motors and starter panels are securely grounded.</item>
<item id="c00fs001l014" label="14.">Ensure that area is well-ventilated when using cleaning compound or solvent.  Avoid prolonged breathing of fumes and compound or solvent contact with skin or eyes.</item>
