Developer

Deployment of code artifacts.

Technical Writer

Documentation of configuration steps and verification.

2.2. Software and Tool Requirements

Ensure the following software and access are available prior to beginning the procedure:

Version Control: Git client installed and access to the production-release branch on GitHub.

Configuration Management: Access to the Confluence space for documentation updates.

API Access: Valid credentials for the MuleSoft gateway API.

3. Detailed Procedure: [Main Task Title]

This section details the step-by-step process for [specific task, e.g., Deploying the Data Ingestion Service].

3.1. Verify Database Connection

Log in to the database server using SSH: ssh sysadmin@[server-ip]

Execute the connection test script: sudo /opt/scripts/db_test.sh

Expected Output: A return code of 0 and the message: [DB_NAME] Connection successful.

If connection fails, submit a Jira ticket to the Database team (Project: DB, Component: Connectivity).

3.2. Configuration File Update (JSON/YAML)

The primary configuration file (config.json) must be updated to point to the new Salesforce endpoint.

Navigate to the configuration directory: cd /app/services/data_ingest/

Open config.json using the editor: vim config.json

Modify the salesforceEndpoint parameter:

"apiSettings": {
    "version": "v58.0",
    "salesforceEndpoint": "[https://new-va-instance.salesforce.com/api](https://new-va-instance.salesforce.com/api)" 
    // Ensure this URL is correctly specified for 508-compliant error handling.
}


Save and close the file.

3.3. Restart Service and Verification

Restart the service using the system manager: sudo systemctl restart data-ingestion-service

Wait 60 seconds for the service to stabilize.

Verification (API Check): Execute the following test call to verify successful integration:

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/healthcheck" -H "accept: application/json"


Expected Result: The API must return an HTTP status code 200 with the following body, confirming the Oracle connection status is UP.

{
  "status": "UP",
  "dependencies": [
    {"name": "Oracle", "status": "UP"}
  ]
}
